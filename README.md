# WebSite Generator

**WebSite Generator** is a lightweight macOS app that lets you build and edit websites using natural language. Just describe what you want, and the app generates and updates HTML code in real time using a connected LLM (Large Language Model). Perfect for quickly prototyping webpages without writing code manually.

To use the app, you need to provide your API credentials. See `Secrets.example.plist` for the required format.
